Note: example for each input file will be made available on Zenodo upon publication.

bedtools_dir
Path to bedtools executable
A string.

cre
Path to cis-regulatory element .bed file
A string that points to a .bed file with five columns: chromosome, start, end, cell types, and cell type groups. Each row is a candidate CRE.

snp
Path to fine-mapped SNPs
A string that points to a data frame with five columns: chromosome, start, end, snp id, and snp PIP. Each row is a SNP.

pip_cutoff
Minimum PIP of SNPs for calcualting gene scores
A number between 0 and 1.

score_cutoff
Gene score cutoff for defining high-confidence putative causal gene
A number.

contact
Path to chromatin contact files for linking CREs to genes
A string that points to a data frame with two columns: data_type and data_path.

qtl
Path to QTL files for linking CREs to genes
A string that points to a data frame with two columns: data_type and data_path.

exonic
Path to fine-mapped SNPs in exons
A string that points to a data frame with three columns: snp, snp_pip, and gene_exon.

nearest
Path to the nearest gene of each candidate CRE
A string that points to a data frame with two columns: cre, nearest_gene

plot_params
Path to ggplot parameters
A string that points to a list with three elements: high - a string which is the hex code of the color for high-score genes; breaks - either NULL or a vector of numbers that corresponds to the "breaks" argument in the scale_fill_gradient() function; limits - either NULL or a vector of two numbers that corresponds to the "limits" argument in the scale_fill_gradient() function.

gene_info
Path to gene information
A string that points to the gene annotation file.

outname
Output name
A string.

outdir
Output directory
A string.
